### Getting_Cleaning Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

                                                          Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set EXTRACTED AS .TXT FILE

2. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that i performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

3. Analysis R  
# Excuted the following:
 Load train datasets
 Load test datasets
 merge datasets
 Convert classLabels to activityName basically. More explicit.
